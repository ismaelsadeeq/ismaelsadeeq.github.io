I currently contribute full-time to [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/). 
I work from the [2140](https://2140.dev/) Bitcoin protocol development office in Amsterdam, Netherlands, sponsored by [Btrust](https://www.btrust.tech/) and 2140.

I was raised in Nigeria and earned a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from [Modibbo Adama University](https://mau.edu.ng/about) in Yola, Nigeria.

I started working professionally as a software developer during my third year of university.
Most of my work has been on the server side, though I've occasionally worked on frontend projects too.

I discovered Bitcoin open-source development in 2023 through the [Btrust Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders) Fellowship (formerly Qala).
Bitcoin offered a chance to work with C++, cryptography, and decentralized systems while tackling one of humanity's pressing problems: a broken financial system.
This aligned with my goal of studying low-level systems, networks, mathematics, and algorithms.
Hence, I left my job and started contributing to Bitcoin Core full-time in March 2023. Since then, I worked on fee rate estimation, the mempool component, and other critical parts of the software.

In 2024, I interned at [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/), further deepening my understanding of the Bitcoin protocol.

Beyond my technical work on [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/), I mentor new contributors through the [Btrust Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders) program and [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/).
Occasionally, you can also find me hosting the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/).
