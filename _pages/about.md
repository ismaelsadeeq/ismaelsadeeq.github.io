I currently contribute fulltime to [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).
This include reviewing and proposing pull request that improve the software.


I grew up in Nigeria and studied computer science in my bachelor’ degree.
These studies were fundamental to my current career as an open source contributor because 
it provided the fundamental background necessary for me to be able to work as a software engineer.

I started working as a software developer from my colleague years, working at startups and even experimented building our's with colleagues.
I have always been fascinated with how to use technology to solve problems for humans. Majority of my work has been on the backend of the system, 
however sometimes I dabbled in the frontend as well.


I was introduced to Bitcoin open-source development around 2023 via the [Btrust Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders) Fellowship when it was called Qala.
I started contributing to bitcoin core around March of 2023 focusing on improving the fee rate estimation of the bitcoin core wallet, mempool component, and other critical aspects of the open source software.

Alongside my technical work to [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/), I enjoy mentoring passionate people to also contrubute effectively through 
the same [Btrust Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders) program [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/) and previously hosts the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/).
