The component that handles fee estimation is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code>.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Because it’s solely based on historical data (looking at how long mempool transactions take to confirm), it cannot react quickly to changing conditions.”<br> — sipa</p> </blockquote> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code> observes how long mempool transactions historically take to confirm. It assumes that if some number of mempool transactions with a certain fee rate have been confirmed after a specific number of blocks in the past, using that same fee rate for your transaction will likely result in a similar confirmation time.</p> <p>However, this assumption may not hold if the mempool’s state changes. The historical data may not accurately reflect the current situation.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Because it’s aiming to match seen behaviour rather than a requirement, if some non-negligible fraction of users keeps paying a certain high feerate, it may try to match that, even if it is unnecessary for confirmation.”<br> — sipa</p> </blockquote> <p>If a node’s mempool primarily contains high–fee-rate transactions due to mempool differences, the mempool transactions that end up confirming will also be high–fee-rate transactions. This can lead to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code> producing high fee rate estimates. Transactions with such high fee rates will likely be confirmed in a short time, but at the cost of paying more than necessary.</p> <p>Similarly, if the node’s mempool predominantly comprises low–fee-rate transactions, and the mempool transactions that confirm also have low fee rates, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code> will tend to provide lower fee estimates. Miners may be less likely to pick such transactions because they are not sufficiently incentivized to include them in a block. This reflects the estimator’s tendency to align with the observed behaviour of transactions that have historically been confirmed.</p> <blockquote> <p>“The new fee estimator is much better at reacting to large volatility in tx throughput, but ignores the mempool.”<br> — kallewoof</p> </blockquote> <p>This statement implies that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code> is designed to react and adjust fee estimates based on historical data and trends related to how mempool transaction fee rates are confirmed over time. It takes into account the past behaviour of transactions in terms of their fee rates and confirmation times to predict future fee rates. However, it may not consider real-time or current conditions in the mempool when making these estimations, which could lead to discrepancies or inaccuracies during times of sudden changes or fluctuations in transaction throughput.</p> <h3 id="analysis-to-confirm-that-cblockpolicyestimator-is-unreliable-in-some-situations">Analysis to Confirm That <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code> Is Unreliable in Some Situations</h3> <p>I have been watching the blockchain for a while to verify the behavior of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code>.

One major hurdle is unpredictable block confirmation times. Sometimes blocks are mined quickly, while at other times they can take over an hour.</p> <p>When blocks are mined quickly, miners’ mempools are cleared, resulting in a shallow mempool with lower–fee-rate transactions because higher–fee-rate transactions have already been mined. This reduces the fee rate required for a transaction to be included in the next block. If fee estimators do not consider the current state of the mempool, users may overpay.</p> <p>Conversely, during congested periods with longer block confirmation times, failing to consider the state and size of the mempool can result in transactions becoming stuck due to underpayment.</p> <p>Accounting for the state of the mempool is difficult because each user has a unique view of it, influenced by connectivity and policy rules. If a user’s mempool is not well synchronized with miners’ mempools, fee estimates may be biased.</p> <p>For example, if a user’s mempool mostly contains low–fee-rate transactions while miners primarily see high–fee-rate transactions, the user’s transactions may get stuck due to insufficient fees. Conversely, if a user’s mempool is dominated by high–fee-rate transactions while miners mostly see lower–fee-rate transactions, the user may overpay.</p> <p>Failing to consider the current mempool state can lead to delayed or overpriced transactions, and mismatched mempool views further complicate accurate fee estimation.</p> <h4 id="improvement-proposal">Improvement Proposal</h4> <p>A mempool-based fee estimator is currently being proposed in Bitcoin Core. It will check whether nodes’ mempools roughly align with the global mempool observed by miners. If a node’s mempool policy differs significantly from that of miners, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CBlockPolicyEstimator</code> should be used instead.</p> <p>Until it is observed that a node has a mempool nearly identical to that of miners, a mempool-based fee estimator will not be reliable.</p> <p>These are heuristics, and the proposal is still in its early stages. More insights and reviews are required to ensure the checks function as intended.</p> <h4 id="in-summary">In Summary</h4> <p>Because of the constraints discussed above, no fee estimate can ever be completely accurate in predicting future events. If your transaction takes significantly longer to confirm than expected, don’t worry.</p> <p>In most cases, you have two tools available: <em>replace-by-fee</em> and <em>CPFP</em>—the fee-bumping tag team. While the details of replace-by-fee and CPFP, along with scenarios where they may not rescue a stuck transaction, are beyond the scope of this article, they make for an interesting <a href="https://gist.github.com/glozow/3de85d7e4fc58c5723f8fcbf21e5e795" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">read</a>.</p> <p>If a transaction overpaid, however—tough luck. There is no “undo” button. A valid transaction will remain valid and will eventually be picked up by a miner. Consider it your generous contribution to a miner’s retirement fund.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Abubakar Sadiq Ismail. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?c15de51d4bb57887caa2c21988d97279"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> </body> </html>
