This book was recommended as part of our tertiary institution evaluation process in the English literature section. However, I read and re-read it because I enjoyed the story and the writing.
Tayo and Vanessa’s love story is classic. It explores love in the diaspora and how duty and desire can affect its unfolding. I recommend reading it.
