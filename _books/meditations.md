I cannot remember how I came across this masterpiece; however, it is a timeless classic. Whenever I read the book, I try to incorporate Marcus’ ideas into my life—whether about external influences, self-control, how to react to external factors, how to behave, living a life of service, performing one’s duty, and discipline.

This is one of my favourite books of all time.
