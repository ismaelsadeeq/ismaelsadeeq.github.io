I learned about a dark period in Nigeria’s history, the 1966 to 1970 Biafran War, through Achebe’s personal account. I picked this from my father’s shelf.
Unfortunately, this history was not taught in school. Reading it from the perspective of an Igbo scholar is very different from how this history is perceived in Northern Nigeria. I hope this history is incorporated back into the school curriculum.
