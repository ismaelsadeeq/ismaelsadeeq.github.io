The Reach of Explanations was an interesting read, and one of the key takeaways for me is
that explanations are conjectures that have been tested and scrutinised using the scientific method
When humanity started explaining phenomena using this approach sprouts the Enlightenment era, which can be envisioned  here https://deep-timeline.oberbrunner.com/


Closer to Reality is quite an obvious read to me, but still interesting.
