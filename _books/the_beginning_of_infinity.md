The Beginning of Infinity offers a compelling argument that explanations are conjectures tested through rigorous scrutiny and the scientific method.

The book’s most striking insight is how the pursuit of deeper explanations—rather than accepting surface observations, dogma, or authority—sparked the Enlightenment. You can visualize this shift at https://deep-timeline.oberbrunner.com/.

Sections such as *Creation* and *The Path to Infinity* were particularly enjoyable and reinforced the idea that progress has no fundamental upper bound.
